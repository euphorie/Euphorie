    <h2 i18n:translate="header_risk_aware">Are you aware of all the risks?</h2>
    <p i18n:translate="intro_risk_aware">Including the risks to your employees and your equipment?  What if there is an accident with one of the machines? What if an employee is exposed to hazardous substances? A risk assessment helps you to define these risks and tackle them head on. A risk assessment mainly consists of two parts: a
      <em>list</em>
      with all the risks in your company and an
      <em>action plan</em>
      with details of how to deal with these risks. These two components allow you to limit the risks to your employees and your company, and therefore the financial risk.</p>

    <h2 i18n:translate="header_not_complicated">The assessment is not complicated</h2>
    <p i18n:translate="intro_not_complicated">Complicated? Not really. It just takes a bit of time. However, the RA is important. So important that it is a legal requirement. This is for good reason. If risks are not assessed or properly dealt with, a suitable risk management process cannot be started and appropriate preventive measures are unlikely to be found or put in place.</p>

    <h2 i18n:translate="header_consultation_of_workers">Consultation and participation of workers</h2>
    <p i18n:translate="intro_consultation_of_workers">Workers or workers' representatives with specific responsibility for the safety and health of workers shall take part in a balanced way or shall be consulted in advance and in good time by the employer with regard to risk assessment</p>

    <h2 i18n:translate="header_oira_tool">The OiRA tool</h2>
    <p i18n:translate="intro_oira_tool">This risk assessment tool is mainly intended for micro (less than 10 workers) and small (less than 50 workers) enterprises/organisations.</p>
