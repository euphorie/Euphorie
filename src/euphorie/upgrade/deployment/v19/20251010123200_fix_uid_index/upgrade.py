class FixUidIndex(UpgradeStep):
    """Fix UID index inconsistencies.

    The 20251006201600_ensure_uid upgrade step ensured that all content
    has a UID assigned to it.  But that was not enough to fix all problems.
    So we need to take over some more code from this script:
    https://github.com/zestsoftware/plonescripts/blob/master/fix_uid_index.py

    That script first checks paths in actual_catalog.uids.keys(), but that did
    not surface any problems in our case, so we skip that part here.

    Then it really checks the UID index.  This has two internal BTrees
    that can get out of sync:

        1) _index: UID -> doc id
        2) _unindex: doc id -> UID

    And indeed we see problems there in a test site:

        Number of _index uid keys:      198801, unique: 198801
        Number of _index doc id values: 198801, unique: 198801
        Number of _unindex doc id keys: 419339, unique: 419339
        Number of _unindex uid values:  419339, unique: 245707

    Normally, all these numbers should all be the same.
    This is not the case for us.

    The script tries to register intids for all objects that are missing them,
    but we don't have that problem.  So we skip that part.
