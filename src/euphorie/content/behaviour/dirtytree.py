"""
Dirty tree tracking
-------------------

It can be useful to know if a content tree has any unpublished changes. This
behaviour manages that by tracking creation, deletion, moving and modification
of content objects and updating a dirty flag on the first parent object which
provides the :py:obj:`IDirtyTreeRoot` marker interface. The flag is reset on
succesfull workflow transitions.
