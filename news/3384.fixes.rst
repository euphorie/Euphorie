- Do not display measures-in-place fieldset if there are no measures.
- Missing div makes back button show on right instead of left
- fix another wrap problem in the french method part
- markup fix: modal medium width
- missing pat-bumper classes on button-bars
- clean duplicated tag
- fix the help injection statement
- added missing label to edit organisation panel
- Fix problem of all tabs being current. There is no such thing as repeat.first, should be repeat.start
- If there are no tools, the available tools portlet should not show. But if the condition is on the main node, the dashboard injection fails and we get an eternal spinner. Therefore the condition goes one item down and we have a stub left to inject.
- make the add panel medium instead of small
- adding link to the help section for organisations
- Remove obsolete Class
- Fix the full sentence and correct a few uppercases in the Translations. (Even if there are no sessions to clone yet, user needs to know that it will be possible)
- make the well stick to its state - open or closed - as user desires
- Better fix for no existing measures (the condition checked only if there are measures, but not the flag whether measures should show in place at all). Avoiding an empty fieldset, thus saving space, which proves important for users to see more below.
