  flawed, no validation is applied to the measures. This allows a user to

  because of a SQL error in the background. Therefore, we silently eliminate
  illegal date values now.
- Translation updates Dutch (NL) and Icelandic (IS)

10.0.2 (2018-11-14)

- Translation changes nl_BE

9.0.41 (2018-08-06)

  module->module->Optional module


9.0.40 (2018-07-13)
-------------------

- Italy: more translation changes
- Italy special: insert a fixed text snippet at the end of every risk description
  in the identification phase

-------------------

- Label change: "Obsolete OiRA tool" instead of "Survey"
- Translation fix for IT


9.0.36 (2018-04-26)
-------------------

- Translation updates in Castillian (es), Catalan (ca) and Dutch (nl)
- Fix undefined variable (#120)
- Major rework of how the lines for the Action Plan XLS are
  computed. We are re-using the logic from Status, so that risks in
  optional modules that are deactivated can be filtered out.
  Also, some "hand-written" SQL queries are replaced by
  sqlalchemy ones.
- Optional modules: until the user has explicitely answered the module
  question as "Yes", consider this module skipped.


9.0.35 (2018-03-16)
-------------------

Changed:

- Provide the current language code in a hidden metadata section of the body, so
  that Piwik code can pick it up easily (in addition to the already present
  country, sector and tool name.
- Identification report (RTF): formatting changes


9.0.34 (2018-02-14)
-------------------

Changed:

- In the Identification Report, handle links and lists that are present in the
  markup in a better way.
- In the Status page / Overview of Risks report: Risks answered with "Does not
  apply" are no longer counted as "no risk" or "not answered", but are not shown
  in the report at all.


9.0.33 (2018-01-17)
-------------------

Changed:

- In the Identification Report (list of all risks), show the Legal References,
  if present. (TNO only, since this report is customised for EU-OSHA)

9.0.32.1 (2018-03-06)
---------------------

- Urgent changes to the HR Translations


9.0.32 (2018-01-17)
-------------------

Changed:

- In the CMS, the sector edit form has gotten simpler. Since tool creators
  cannot influence the colour scheme any more, the colour picker and the
  preview have been removed. This allows us to get rid of the accordion
  and should help to fix recurring problems from TNO in resetting the
  password.
- Profile Questions: in 2012, optional profile questions were removed, and
  merged with the concept of repeatable profile questions. As user and tool
  creator feedback has shown, there are valid use-cases where a profile should
  be optional, but asking about one or more locations does not make sense.
  Therefore, the "location" aka repeatable part of a profile question can now
  be switched off in the CMS.


9.0.31 (2017-12-14)
-------------------

Fixed:

- When the logic to correctly skip disabled modules in the status report was
  introduced in 9.0.26, it caused a new bug for tools that contain repeatable
  profile questions. Profile questions are now handled correctly again.


Changed:

- In the CMS, conditional fields (that only appear when a checkbox is ticked)
  can now be set to "required" and properly validated. Therefore the "question"
  field for optional modules and the "tool notification" title and text fields
  are now required.
- Translations for Croatian (HR)


9.0.30 (2017-11-27)
-------------------

Changed:

- Translations for Croatian (HR)

9.0.29 (2017-11-21)
-------------------

Fixed:

- Workaraound for #114
  (by reverting the doctype on risk_actionplan to its old state)
  Needs to be fixed upstream in Patternslib/pat-clone

Changed:

- Translations for German (DE)
- It is no longer possible to pick an additional sentence to be displayed
  under the risk title via the CMS. If existing measures are present, the
  pre-defined sentence is simply shown in the client


9.0.28 (2017-11-13)
-------------------

Changed:

- Translations for Croatian (HR)
- Use HTML5 doctype in all client templates
- Special customisations per country now possible. Only used for Italy:
  - Generally skip evaluation
  - Colour adjustment in the answer-type legend

Added:

  (Currently only used in an add-on)

9.0.27 (2017-10-12)
-------------------

-------------------

Changed:

- Updated styles, added latest Patterns

Fixed:

  disabled optional modules to be falsely shown in certain cases. The
  logic for computing the risks to consider has been improved to fix
  this bug.

9.0.25 (2017-09-27)
-------------------

Fixed:

- When a tool with a profile question was updated, and that tool has a
  custom splash message, that message now gets shown correctly instead
  of a blurred overlay.

Changed:

- Translation for Croatian (HR)


9.0.24 (2017-09-14)
-------------------

- Excel Report: Also ignore measures of risks that have been answered
  with "yes" (requested by TNO)


9.0.23 (2017-09-04)
-------------------

- Improve Excel report fix from 9.0.22: Don't write empty line when an
  entry is skipped
- Actually consider the allow_guest_accounts setting from the app-
  config. Don't allow guest login if it is not enabled.
- Translation fixes in Croatian


9.0.22 (2017-08-21)

Upgrade notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**This is a beta release with incomplete translations.**

Python 2.7 is now fully supported and the recommended Python version to use.
Python 2.6 is still supported.

zc.buildout has been updated to version 2. You will need to re-bootstrap your
buildout when upgrading to Euphorie 6.

This release updates the profile version to *13*. Please use the upgrade
feature in ``portal_setup`` to upgrade the ``euphorie.deployment:default``
profile to this version.

This release also updates the used Plone version to 4.2.4. You are advised to
perform the Plone migrations through the Zope Management Interface (ZMI).

The Euphorie configuration file (``etc/euphorie.ini`` in the standard buildout)
no longer needs to include the complete configuration. You now only need to
specify details that are specific to your deployment such as the Google Analytics
accounts and client URL.

Feature changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add a small FAQ to the login page.
- IE 6 is no longer supported. IE 7 is only provisionally supported: it might
  work, but any bugs will no longer be fixed.
- Add a legend to the client navigation tree to explain the used icons. This
  fixes `ticket 51 <https://github.com/euphorie/Euphorie/issues/51>`_.
- Optional profile questions have been replaced with option modules. Previous
  versions supported both, and they did almost exactly the same thing which was
  a source of consution. All existing optional profile questions will
  automatically be converted to optional modules as part of the upgrade.
- Added translations for Finnish (FI) and Lithuanian (LT)
- Updated Bulgarian translations.
- Include a default application configuration file.

- Correctly show the high-priority notice for risks in the online view of
  the action plan report.

  `46 <https://github.com/euphorie/Euphorie/issues/46>`_.

  page for the client. This fixes `ticket 75
  <https://github.com/euphorie/Euphorie/issues/75>`_.

  helps for browsers/computers that do not include the unicode warning
  symbol in their font. This fixes `ticket 61
  <https://github.com/euphorie/Euphorie/issues/61>`_.

- Change default font for page titles in the client to a font which does not
  have problems with Greek characters. This fixes `ticket 74
  <https://github.com/euphorie/Euphorie/issues/74>`_.

- Dutch Translation: Fix bad column header in timeline report.

- Correct rendering of strong text in the client to make sure it is easy to
  read. This fixes `ticket 65

--------------------

Upgrade notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release updates the profile version to *11*. Please use the upgrade
feature in ``portal_setup`` to upgrade the ``euphorie.deployment:default``
profile to this version. For large systems this migration spent a long
time in a SQL migration; in that situation it may be useful to run a
manual SQL migration step by hand first: connect to the database and
issue these SQL statements::

    ALTER TABLE action_plan ADD COLUMN reference TEXT;
    ALTER TABLE account ALTER COLUMN password DROP NOT NULL;


Feature changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Expose client functionality with via simple REST API.
  [wichert]


3.2.3 - May 16, 2012

  looking up risk data.
  [wichert]

feature in ``portal_setup`` to upgrade the ``euphorie.deployment:default``
profile to this version. For large systems this migration spent a long

issue this SQL statement::

    ALTER TABLE tree ADD has_description bool DEFAULT 'f';

Feature changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Remove warning-icon for risks with a problem description in the action plan
  report. Since this report only contains present risks the icon was not useful.
  This fixes `TNO ticket 219
  <https://code.simplon.biz/tracker/tno-euphorie/ticket/219>`_.
  [wichert]

- Change default for top5 risks to not be present to work around frequent abuse
  of top5 risks by sector organisations. They will still always be included in
  reports even if not present. This fixes `TNO ticket 216
  <https://code.simplon.biz/tracker/tno-euphorie/ticket/216>`_.
  [wichert]

  This fixes `TNO ticket 197

  [wichert]

- Fix case handling of email addresses when changing the email address
  in the client. Previously it was possible to change to an email address

  Prototype, while zrtresource will give us the proper browserresource paths in
  Euphorie. One caveat is that we now have to minify the browserresource file
  (i.e ``http://localhost:4080/Plone2/client/++resource++screen-ie6.css``) instead

----------------------

  [wichert]
