--------------------

Upgrade notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release updates the profile version to *11*. Please use the upgrade
feature in ``portal_setup`` to upgrade the ``euphorie.deployment:default``
profile to this version. For large systems this migration spent a long
time in a SQL migration; in that situation it may be useful to run a
manual SQL migration step by hand first: connect to the database and
issue these SQL statements::

    ALTER TABLE action_plan ADD COLUMN reference TEXT;
    ALTER TABLE account ALTER COLUMN password DROP NOT NULL;


Feature changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Expose client functionality with via simple REST API.
  [wichert]


3.2.3 - May 16, 2012
--------------------

  SQL compliant, but makes the query run 20-50 times faster.
  [wichert]

- SQL performance work: add two extra indices to improve performance for
  looking up risk data.
  [wichert]


3.2.2 - May 14, 2012

Upgrade notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release updates the profile version to *10*. Please use the upgrade
feature in ``portal_setup`` to upgrade the ``euphorie.deployment:default``
profile to this version. For large systems this migration spent a long
time in a SQL migration; in that situation it may be useful to run a
manual SQL migration step by hand first: connect to the database and
issue this SQL statement::

    ALTER TABLE tree ADD has_description bool DEFAULT 'f';

Feature changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Remove warning-icon for risks with a problem description in the action plan
  report. Since this report only contains present risks the icon was not useful.
  This fixes `TNO ticket 219
  <https://code.simplon.biz/tracker/tno-euphorie/ticket/219>`_.
  [wichert]

- Change default for top5 risks to not be present to work around frequent abuse
  of top5 risks by sector organisations. They will still always be included in
  reports even if not present. This fixes `TNO ticket 216
  <https://code.simplon.biz/tracker/tno-euphorie/ticket/216>`_.
  [wichert]

- Change default for optional modules to present based on user feedback.
  This fixes `TNO ticket 197
  <https://code.simplon.biz/tracker/tno-euphorie/ticket/197>`_.
  [wichert]

  it is skipped in the client. This fixes `TNO ticket 213

  <https://code.simplon.biz/tracker/tno-euphorie/ticket/193>`_.
  [wichert]

- Fix case handling of email addresses when changing the email address
  in the client. Previously it was possible to change to an email address
  with capital, after which login was no longer possible.  This fixes 
  a final part of `TNO ticket 194
  <https://code.simplon.biz/tracker/tno-euphorie/ticket/194>`_.

  [wichert]

- Position images for module views on the right side of the page so they
  do not break running text as badly. This should fix `TNO ticket 211

  [wichert]

- Use a slightly larger image size for the module views, and enable

-----------------------

Upgrade notes

Development of Euphorie and related projecst has moved to the 
`euphorie organisation <https://github.com/euphorie>`_ on github.

feature in ``portal_setup`` to upgrade the ``euphorie.deployment:default``
profile to this version.

  compile screen-ie6.css. This allows Cornelis to use physical paths in his
  Prototype, while zrtresource will give us the proper browserresource paths in
  Euphorie. One caveat is that we now have to minify the browserresource file
  (i.e ``http://localhost:4080/Plone2/client/++resource++screen-ie6.css``) instead

  client surveys were cataloged.

  is now used for the LoginField 
  [thomas]

- Added msgid "label_preview", Default "Preview", as disambiguation
  from "header_preview" (Preview survey) and "button_preview"
  (Create preview)
  [thomas]

----------------------

Feature changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  [wichert]

- Do not accept pre-1900 dates in the action plan, since they break rendering
